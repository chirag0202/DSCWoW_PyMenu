We are a team of three geeks working extensively on **devops, automation and cloud**.
## Base OS used
**Linux** - RedHat v8.0
## About the project
Our project **WoWMenu** is a simple Python menu-based-program that allows us to run some basic functionalities like Linux commands, container management using Docker, BigData architecture using Hadoop, AWS cloud fuctions and much more. Most of the functionalities have been integrated using Ansible playbooks. 

Our motive is to prevent rigorous mugging up the commands and in that place, the user will only need to select the task to perform and the inputs that are required to be given. 
All the commands that would be required to be run the task shall be handled by the Python program and the setup would be ready before us in just a few minutes!
## System requirements
- [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) OS (recommended)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) setup in main system
- [Boto 3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/) in case of running AWS using WoWMenu
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed
## How to use?
If someone wants to use/test _WoWMenu_ on their system, just follow these simple steps!

1. Clone this repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/chirag0202/DSCWoW_WoWMenu.git`.
2. Get into the `DSCWoW_WoWMenu` folder.
3. Run the program using the command `python3 frontend.py`.
## Quick guide to the UI
The program has a simple python menu-based UI in which the list of available options are available.
The user has to select the task of choice from the list and give the prompted inputs as required. Some hitting of enters are enough for the task to be done!
## Demo
As the demo, a powerpoint presentation describing the basics of the project along with a demo-video on the working prototype have been uploaded. Do have a look on them!
