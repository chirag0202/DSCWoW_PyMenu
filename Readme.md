We are a team of three geeks working extensively on **devops, automation and cloud**.
## Base OS used
**Linux** - RedHat v8.0
## About the project
Our project **WoWMenu** is a simple Python menu-based-program that allows us to run some basic functionalities like Linux commands, container management using Docker, BigData architecture using Hadoop, AWS cloud fuctions and much more. Most of the functionalities have been integrated using Ansible playbooks. 

Our motive is to prevent rigorous mugging up the commands and in that place, the user will only need to select the task to perform and the inputs that are required to be given. 
All the commands that would be required to be run the task shall be handled by the Python program and the setup would be ready before us in just a few minutes!
